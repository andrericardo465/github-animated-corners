GitHub Animated Corners
=======================

Inspired by [Tom Preston-Werner's](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons) and [Tim Holman's](https://tholman.com/github-corners/) works, I decided to create a few more variants of animated corners with octocat for my projects. But I will be glad if this work is useful for your pages too.

These variants do not require JavaScript and additional files. They use only [SVG](https://github.com/eugena/github-animated-corners/tree/main/svg) vector paths so don't lose quality when zooming.

Please watch the [Live Demo](https://eugena.github.io/github-animated-corners) to choose a variant for your page or website.

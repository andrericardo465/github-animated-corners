GitHub Animated Corners
=======================

Inspired by [Tom Preston-Werner's](https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons) and [Tim Holman's](https://tholman.com/github-corners/) works, I decided to create a few more variants of animated corners with octocat for my projects. But I will be glad if this work is useful for your pages too.

These variants do not require JavaScript and additional files. They use only vector paths so don't lose quality when zooming.

Please watch the [Live Demo](https://eugena.github.io/github-animated-corners) to choose a variant for your page or website.
